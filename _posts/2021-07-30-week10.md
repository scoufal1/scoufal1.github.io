title: Week 10
---

This week was spent wrapping up my project. In my meeting with my mentor, we discussed the design for the future study, such as how many groups the participants should be divided into, what the participants should do during the experiment, and which questionnaires should be used to measure the participants’ cybersickness. I have also been coordinating with the PhD student who will be running the study so that he can take over the Unity projects. To finish up the week, I presented my work to my mentor’s lab. It was interesting to hear the perspectives and questions from other students in the lab.
