This week, I met with my mentor, Dr. Victoria Interrante, and discussed the projects that she is working on. We decided that I would work on a project to prevent cybersickness in virtual reality experiences. Many people experience nausea, eye strain, or other types of sickness when using VR technology. The objective of this project is to develop non photorealistic filters in order to reduce the detail of the environment, which may be less sickness inducing than a very photorealistic, detailed environment. 

I began working by exploring a game engine called Unity that will be used for this project. I don’t have prior experience with Unity, so I’ve spent most of my time going through tutorials to familiarize myself with this engine.
